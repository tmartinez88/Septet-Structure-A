Description of the Work
This software work is an early attempt at understanding and modeling concepts in evolutionary biopolitics. I am interested in how groups of things interact with each other, the complexity that can emerge from this, and how these exercises can lend themselves to audio/visual composition.

bio
Tommy is a New York City based composer and technologist working mostly with guitar, synthesis, electroacoustics and code. His projects often begin with computational research exploring physical sound models and psychoacoustic phenomena. He is interested in algorithmic approaches to music making, simulation, and manifestations of identity, tradition and history in electronic audio culture.
